# Loan-Default-Prediction-and-Customer-Eligibility-Assessment-Utilising-Historical-Data-

Objective :
   1. In this capstone project, we comprehensively analyse historical loan data extracted from 
customers' banking records to refine the approval process. Our main goal is to provide 
financial institutions with data-driven insights to identify optimal candidates for loan 
approvals. 
   2. This project addresses the imperative need for more robust risk mitigation 
strategies in the lending domain, offering a valuable contribution to the financial sector's 
decision-making framework
   3. In short we are going to predict if a customer will default a loan payment.
